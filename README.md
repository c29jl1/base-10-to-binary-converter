# Binary Calculator

This project is a simple binary calculator that allows users to perform binary operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. It features a user-friendly interface and audio feedback for button presses.

## Files Overview

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the binary calculator application. It includes a display for showing binary numbers and buttons for binary operations and basic functionalities (clear, calculate).

- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for the binary calculator. It includes functions to handle binary calculations, such as converting decimal to binary, performing binary operations, and updating the display based on user input.

- **style.css**: Contains the styles for the binary calculator application. It defines the appearance of the calculator, including button styles, display styles, and layout.

- **typewriter.mp3**: An audio file that plays a typewriter sound effect when buttons are pressed.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to input binary numbers and select operations.
3. The result will be displayed in the calculator's display area.
4. Use the "C" button to clear the last entry or "AC" to clear all entries.

## Features

- Supports basic binary operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR.
- Clear and calculate functionalities.
- Audio feedback for a better user experience.

## Future Improvements
